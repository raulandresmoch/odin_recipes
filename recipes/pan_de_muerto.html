<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li> ¼ cup milk</li>
    <li> ¼ cup butter or margarine</li>
    <li> ¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
    <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li> ¼ cup white sugar</li>

    <li> 1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>To make the bread: Heat milk and butter in a medium saucepan over low heat until butter melts. Remove from heat and add warm water. Mixture should be around 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, anise seed, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Beat in warm milk mixture, then add eggs and orange zest; beat until well combined. Stir in 1/2 cup flour and continue adding more flour until dough is soft.</li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic. Place dough into a lightly greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Punch dough down and shape into a large round loaf with a round knob on top. Place dough onto a baking sheet; loosely cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until just about doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool slightly before brushing with glaze.</li>
    <li>To make the glaze: Combine 1/4 cup sugar, orange juice, and orange zest in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 2 minutes. Brush glaze over top of warm bread. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar.</li>
